Multi-page components for Databricks App

This folder is reserved for Streamlit multi-page apps.
Currently, the app uses a single-page design with sidebar navigation.

If you want to split into separate pages, create files like:
- 1_Overview.py
- 2_Projects.py
- 3_Details.py
- 4_Analytics.py

Streamlit will automatically detect and create navigation.
